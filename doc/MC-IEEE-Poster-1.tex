 \maketitle

   \block{Abstract}{  In 1881, the problem of computing the plane tangent to three spheres was
  set as an exercise in a textbook, {em Practical Solid Geometry}\cite{payne1881}.
  We have solved this problem in JavaScript, producing an interactive,
  browser-based web page that dynamically solves the problem.
  All of the code is released under the GNU Public License.
  We propose constructing a ``soft'' Stewart platform using this theory which
  allows us to control the inclination of two planes with a very simple
  mechanism powered only by phase change of a liquid to a gas or by pneumatics.
  Future work includes computing the Jacobian of a ``tentacle'' formed
  by stringing together many such Stewart Platforms, thus providing a
  theoretical model for a simple, inexpensive, ``soft'' tentacle.
  Such a tentacle can be scaled down nicely for {\em in vivo} medical
  applications such as endoscopy and arterial catheterization.

  \block{Problem: Three Touching Circles}{

    Our goal is to be able to determine the orientation of plane resting on top of
    three spheres of different radii which are touching each
other.
Because there is a plane through any three points and we have three spheres, we can
construct the plane through
the center of these points.
The projection of the edges of the spheres onto this plane form three touching circles.
Knowing the position of these circles is a valuable prelude to solving the
three dimensional problem.

We seek a formula for the coordinates of the third circle in terms of three input radii $r_1,r_2,r_3$.

Because the distance between adjacent circles is the sum of their radii, define:
\begin{align}
a  &= r_2 + r_3 \\
b  &= r_1 + r_3 \\
c  &= r_1 + r_2
     \end{align}

Then we can use the cosine law to compute the angle $\angle ABC = \theta$:

\begin{align}
  \theta  &= \arccos{\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2bc}} \\
  \theta  &= \arccos{\frac{(r_2+r_3)^2 + (r_1+r_3)^2 - (r_1+r_2)^2}{2(r_2+r_3)(r_1+r_3)}} \\
\end{align}

It is clear that once $\theta$ has been calculated:

\begin{align}
 C_y  &= a\sin{\theta}
\end{align}
Allowing us to form a right triangle $\triangle ACD$ and use the Pythagorean theorem:
\begin{align}
  b^2  &= C_y^2 + (r_1-C_x)^2 \\
  b^2 - C_y^2  &= (r_1-C_x)^2  \\
  \sqrt{b^2 - C_y^2}  &= r_1-C_x  \\
  C_x &= r_1 -  \sqrt{b^2 - C_y^2}
\end{align}

     \block{Three Sphere Math}{

We seek to compute the normal of the tangent plane.
Observe that this plane is tangent to all three cones.
Observe that the $AB$ cone intersects
the $A$ sphere in a circle on the surface of the $A$ perpendicular to and centered on the $X$ axis.

A vector of length $r_A$ that begins pointing in the $X$ direction and is rotated counterclockwise
about the $Z$-axis by $\pi/2 - \alpha$.

However, we must rotate this vector about the $X$ axis by an unknown amount $\theta$ in order
to bring capture the tilt which is not purely a rotation about the $Z$ axis.
Since this angle is computed in the $ZY$ plane, we compute a projection of the point $V$ into
that plane, forming a triangle in the $ZY$ plane.  Call this point $I_z$, the intersection
of the apex line with the $Z$-axis.

\begin{align}
 \phi &= \arcsin{\frac{r_c}{I_z}}\\
\theta &= \frac{\pi}{2} - (\frac{\pi}{2} - \phi)\\
\theta &= \phi\\
I_z &= U_x(\frac{V_z}{(U_x - V_x})

     \block{The title matter}{
         The title is made by the standard \texttt{\bs maketitle[{\it options}]} command where you can alter the \texttt{width}, the spacing between the title and top of the poster (\texttt{titletotopverticalspace}), the bottom of the title to the main content of the poster (\texttt{titletoblockverticalspace}) and the space between the title information and the logo (\texttt{titlegraphictotitleverticalspace}).

         If the default format of the title is not to your liking, you can define the placement of the different items via the \texttt{\bs settitle} command, described in the manual.
     }
     \block{Blocks}{
         Blocks are arranged in a grid, by default, with width by default \texttt{\bs textwdith}.  They are created by the command
         \begin{quote}
             \bs\texttt{block [{\it options}] \{{\it title}\}\{{\it contents}\}}
         \end{quote}
         The title may be left empty, resulting in no title area being created for the block (as seen in a later block to the right).  Further blocks will be placed below automatically, at a distance defined by \texttt{blockverticalspace}.

         If you want to change the position of the title matter or the contents in the block, you may by setting in the options
         \begin{quote}
             \texttt{titleoffsetx, titleoffsety, bodyoffsetx, bodyoffsety}
         \end{quote}
         which let you adjust the vertical or horizontal position of the two parts of the block, respectively.  You can also make, relative to the default width, the title and block body by setting
         \begin{quote}
             \texttt{titlewidthscale, bodywidthscale}
         \end{quote}
         The title's alignment can be set by \texttt{titleleft, titlecenter, titleright}, the body may be shifted vertically by setting \texttt{bodyverticalshift}, and the shape of the block can be altered by setting \texttt{roundedcorners, linewidth}. The inner margins of the title can by set by \texttt{titleinnersep,bodyinnersep}.

     \note[targetoffsetx=24cm, targetoffsety=-9cm,rotate=1,angle=270,radius=8cm,width=.75\textwidth,innersep=.4cm]{
         You can place notes that are ``attached'' to the previous block using the command
         \begin{quote} \texttt{\bs note[{\it options}]\{{\it contents}\}}\end{quote}
         The note is placed by default slightly to the right of a ``target'' in the center of the previous block.  The note style may also allow for a connection between the note and the ``target''.  \\
         The target may be shifted from the default by setting the options  \texttt{targetoffsetx, targetoffsety}, rotated by an angle with \texttt{rotate}, and its width with \texttt{width}.  The placement of the note in relation with the target is given in polar coordinates with \texttt{ radius, angle}. Please observe that notes are always drawn {\bf over} the other objects. They do not affect the placement of blocks.

     \column{.45}
         \block{Columns}{
              By default, blocks are arranged in a single column. If you want multiple columns for your poster, you may use the \texttt{columns} environment. For example,
             \begin{quote}
                 \texttt{\noindent \bs begin\{columns\}\\
                 \bs column\{.6\}\\
                 \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
                 \bs column\{.4\}\\
                 \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
                 \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
                 \bs end\{columns\}
                 }
             \end{quote}
             will create two columns of 60\% and 40\% the available width; spacing between successive columns is handled automatically.  The block command(s) following \texttt{\bs column} are the blocks to go in that column.  The number of columns is free to be chosen, but the relative widths must all be chosen.  If the widths sum to less than 1, empty space will be seen on the right.  If they sum to more than 1, the latter columns will be cut off.

The functionality is similar to that of columns, but now the widths are relative to the width of the current column.}

             If the default appearance of the title, background, blocks, and notes is not desired, you may change the colors by calling the color style along with a general layout theme with the commands
             \begin{quote}

             \end{quote}
             where the color palette and style and layout style are either the name of a custom made or one of the offered predefined choices listed in the manual or the comments of this poster's source.  Individual changes can be made to the style of the  background, title matter, blocks, inner blocks, and notes by using one of the following (along with either a custom-designed style or a predefined style listed in the manual or the comments of this poster's source).  These changes are made with the commands
             \begin{quote}
                 \texttt{\bs usebackgroundstyle[]\{\}, \bs usetitlestyle[]\{\},\\ \bs useblockstyle[]\{\},\bs innerblockstyle[]\{\}, \bs usenotestyle[]\{\}}
