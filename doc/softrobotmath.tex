  A Stewart Platform\cite{wiki:stewart} is a fundamental mechanism for varying the angle
  between two objects.
  A soft Stewart Platform can be made of two discs and
  three inflatable spheres.
  Stacking such devices might make a soft tentacle.
  Soft robots are meant to deform under force, but it is useful to have
  an analytic description of a plane in contact with three spheres
  before deforming force is applied.
  In 1881, the problem of computing the plane tangent to three spheres was
  set as an exercise in a textbook, {em Practical Solid Geometry}\cite{payne1881},
  but not solved.
  We have solved this problem in JavaScript, producing an interactive,
  browser-based web page that dynamically solves the problem\cite{softrobotcalc}.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Prelude: Three Touching Circles}

Our goal is to be able to determine the orientation of plane resting
on top of three spheres of different radii which are touching each
other.
Because there is a plane through any three points and we have three spheres, we can construct the plane through
the center of these points.
The projection of the edges of the spheres onto this plane form three touching circles.
Knowing the position of these circles is a valuable prelude to solving the three dimenstional problem.

\begin{figure}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/ThreeTouchingCircles.png}
     \caption{Three Touching Circles}
  \label{fig:Tangent}
\end{figure}

To solve this problem most conveniently, we place the first circle on the negative $x$-axis, and the second circle
on the positive $x$-axis, with the circles intersecting at the origin.
The third circle is place in the positive $y$ direction. It's center will not be on the $y$-axis itself unless the
radii of the first two circles are equal.

We seek a formula for the coordinates of the third circle in terms of three input radii $r_1,r_2,r_3$.

Because the distance between adjacent circles is the sum of their radii, define:
\begin{align}
a  &= r_2 + r_3 \\
b  &= r_1 + r_3 \\
c  &= r_1 + r_2
\end{align}

Then we can use the cosine law to compute the angle $\angle ABC = \theta$:


\begin{align}
  \theta  &= \arccos{\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2bc}} \\
  \theta  &= \arccos{\frac{(r_2+r_3)^2 + (r_1+r_3)^2 - (r_1+r_2)^2}{2(r_1+r_3)(r_1+r_2)}} \\
\end{align}

It is clear that once $\theta$ has been calculated:

\begin{align}
 C_y  &= a\sin{\theta}
\end{align}
Allowing us to form a right triangle $\triangle ACD$ and use the Pythagorean theorem:
\begin{align}
  b^2  &= C_y^2 + (r_1-C_x)^2 \\
  b^2 - C_y^2  &= (r_1-C_x)^2  \\
  \sqrt{b^2 - C_y^2}  &= r_1-C_x  \\
  C_x &= r_1 -  \sqrt{b^2 - C_y^2}
\end{align}

\section{A Progression of Problems}

Because we now believe we can model the main problem as the rotation of a plane tangent to a cone about the cone,
there are a number of easier problems which may lead us to a solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In 2D, rotate a tangently line to a circle until it is coincient on an outside point.  That is, given the
  center of a circle $C$, a radius $r$, another point $p$, what angular rotation (measured against $x$-axis) gives
  the rotation that makes a line tangent to $C$ touch $p$?
\item Given two spheres, what is the equation for the cone tangent to both?
  \item Is the problem better thought of as the intersection of several spheres?
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Three Touching Spheres}

Note: This problem is mentioned in an advanaced textbook on solid geometry from 1881\cite{payne1881}.

Our fundamental goal now is to describe three touching spheres. As robotocists,
our interest is in the slope of the plane of the tops of these spheres
as if they were resting on a table. Then by inflating or deflating spheres,
we would be able to control the direction of a plane or platform.
Such a device is sometimes called a parallel manipulator, of which a
Stewart Platform\cite{wiki:stewart} (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stewart_platform&oldid=898429010})
is the best-known example.

The fundamental action of a parallel manipulator is to tilt a plane or platform in a desired direction.
Having developed the math for the three touching circles in the previous section, we now use it
to find the normal of the a plane resting on the top of three spheres by choosing our
coordinate system to the plane defined by the center points of the three spheres.
In this coordinate system, the $z$-coordinate of the center of all spheres is $0$.
The projection of all three spheres into this plane produces three touching circles.
We seek an expression for the normal of the plane of the tops of these spheres as a function
purely of the three radii. Call this plane the {\em top} plane.

As the top plane tilts, the points tangent to this plane move away from the highest points on each of
the three spheres, making the problem more difficult.

This problem can clearly be solved quickly using numerical methods, because by guessing
a candidate normal to the top plane, it is relatively easy to compute an error function based
on the distance between the closest point on each sphere to the top plane and the top plane.
We would expect an iterative approach to converge very quickly.

Nonetheless we seek an analytic solution.

  \label{fig:fixed}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Variable definitions}

We assume that the spheres centered at points $A,B,$ and $C$
of radii $r_A,r_b,$ and $r_c$. We setup our coordinate system as a right-
handed coordinate system with $XZ$ plane contaning the center of all spheres.
The $A$ sphere is placed at the origin, so that $O = A$, and the $B$ sphere
is place on the positive $X$ axis. Without loss of generality assume $r_a \geq r_b \geq r_c$.
Following computer graphics convention, we think of the $Y$ dimension as vertical.

Taking any two spheres defines a cone whose apex is in the $XZ$ plane.
Call the apex of the $AB$ cone $U$, the $AC$ cone $V$, and the $BC$ cone $W$.

We assert that these three points form a line, which we call the {\em apex line}, in the $XZ$ plane and that this
line is the intersection of the {\em tangent plane} touching all three spheres at a single point
with the $XZ$ plane. We will use points $U$ and $V$ in our calculation.
Let $\alpha$ be the half-angle of the $AB$ cone.

It behooves us to name the intersection of the apex line with the $Z$ axis, $I_z$, so
that we can use it in calculations.

\subsection{Strategy}

We seek to compute the normal of the tangent plane.
Observe that this plane is tangent to all three cones.
Observe that the $AB$ cone intersects
the $A$ sphere in a circle on the surface of the $A$ perpendicular to and centered on the $X$ axis.

A vector of length $r_A$ that begins pointing in the $X$ direction and is rotated counterclockwise
about the $Z$-axis by $\pi/2 - \alpha$.

However, we must rotate this vector $N$ about the $X$ axis by an unknown amount, $\gamma$, in order
to orient the vector to line up properly with the desired tilt of the tangent plane despite not being a pure rotation about the $Z$ axis. Since this angle is computed in the $YZ$ plane, we compute a projection of the point $V$ into
that plane, forming a triangle in the $YZ$ plane.  Call this point $I_z$, the intersection
of the apex line with the $Z$-axis. Let $h$ be the height of the intersection of the y-axis with the $AB$ cone.
Then $\gamma$ is the angle we need to rotate the plane by so that it intersects with the $Z$-axis at a point, referred to as $I_z$. By basic geometry of simialr triangles, this is computed from the right triangle of the origin with $h$ and $I_z$.
Having computed $\theta_{ab}$ and $\gamma$, these two degrees of rotation give us the plane tangent to all three spheres, and its corresponding tilt for our desired soft Stewart Platform.

\begin{align}
  \overrightarrow{AB} &= \overrightarrow{A} - \overrightarrow{B} \\
  \overrightarrow{BC} &= \overrightarrow{B} - \overrightarrow{C} \\
  \overrightarrow{CA} &= \overrightarrow{C} - \overrightarrow{A} \\
  \theta_{ab} &= \arcsin{\frac{r_a - r_b}{r_a + r_b}} \\
  \theta_{bc} &= \arcsin{\frac{r_b - r_c}{r_b + r_c}} \\
  \theta_{ca} &= \arcsin{\frac{r_a - r_c}{r_a + r_c}} \\
  \overrightarrow{AB_{apex}} &= \overrightarrow{A} + \hat{\overrightarrow{AB}} \frac{r_a}{\sin{\theta_{ab}}} \\
  \overrightarrow{BC_{apex}} &= \overrightarrow{B} + \hat{\overrightarrow{BC}} \frac{r_b}{\sin{\theta_{bc}}} \\
  \overrightarrow{CA_{apex}} &= \overrightarrow{C} + \hat{\overrightarrow{CA}} \frac{r_c}{\sin{\theta_{ca}}} \\
  \overrightarrow{U} &= \overrightarrow{AB_{apex}} \\
  \overrightarrow{V} &= \overrightarrow{CA_{apex}} \\
  \overrightarrow{W} &= \overrightarrow{BC_{apex}}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
 \gamma &= \arcsin{\frac{h}{I_z}}\\
h &= U_x\tan{\theta_{ab}}\\
I_z &= \frac{U_xV_z}{U_x - V_x}
\end{align}


\subsection{Axis Angle of Cone Enveloping Two Spheres}

The apex angle of a cone which envlopes (by being tangent to) two tangent
circles of radii $r_x,r_y$, is:

\begin{align}
 z &= -2 \frac{r_x^2}{r_x - r_y}\\
 \psi &= 2 \arcsin{\frac{r_x}{z + r_y}} \\
 \psi &= 2 \arcsin{\frac{r_y - r_x}{r_x + r_y}}
\end{align}
where $r1 < r2$ without loss of generality.

\subsection{Computation of $\gamma$ and $\theta$ }

Compute these by considering the three cones that envelope the three spheres
taken in a pair-wise fashion. Let $\theta_{xy}$ be the half-angle of the
aperture of the cone that envelopes sphere $x$ and sphere $y$.

Compute the apices of the three cones, naming the apex of the cone that
envelopes sphere $X$ and sphere $Y$ $\overrightarrow{XY_{apex}}$. It is interesting
to note that the three apices lie on a line, which is where the normal plane
intersects the $XZ$-plane where the center of all the spheres lie.

Let $Z'$ be the $z$ value of the intersection of this line with $z$-axis.

Let the normal of the plane tangent to the three spheres be generated
by a (negative) rotation $\theta_{AB}$ of the $[0,1,0]$ vector about the $Z$-axis followed by a rotation $\gamma$
about the $X$-axis, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rotation}.

     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/RotationMath.png}
     \caption{Rotation Math}
  \label{fig:rotation}
\end{figure}


\begin{align}
  \psi &= \arccos{\hat{\overrightarrow{CA}}_z } \text{(angle of CA against the z axis)} \\
  L &= \| A - CA_{apex} \| \\
  Z' &= L \cos{\psi} \frac{U_x}{U_x-V_x} \\
  \gamma &= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccos{\frac{r_a}{Z'}}\\
  \gamma &= \arcsin{\frac{r_a}{Z'}};
\end{align}

\section{Thing to Research}

Idea: It may be possible to solve for the support points as the intersection of cones\cite{shene1994lower}.

We have solved this problem in JavaScript, producing an interactive, browser-based web page that dynamically solves the problem. All of the code is released under the GNU Public License. We propose constructing a ``soft'' Stewart platform using this theory which  allows us to control the inclination of two planes with a very simple  mechanism powered only by phase change of a liquid to a gas or by pneumatics. Future work includes computing the Jacobian of a ``tentacle'' formed  by stringing together many such Stewart Platforms, thus providing a  theoretical model for a simple, inexpensive, ``soft'' tentacle.  Such a tentacle can be scaled down nicely for {\em in vivo} medical  applications such as endoscopy and arterial catheterization.
