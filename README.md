# softrobotmath
A experimental repo for holding math about soft robotics based on spherical inflated components

## Introduction

This is an experimental repo to house very similar math around the idea of building something like a "Stewart Platform" based mainly on inflatable spheres.

## 2D function

For our first simple model, we are attempting to approach the problem from a 2D Cartesian plot set up. We make a few assumptions included below. These assumptions allowed us to determine first that the 2D model was plausible and gave us parameters for the future 3D model.
